# LAN-Application-Multiplayer-Game
This project consists of a multiplayer game server and client, designed to allow users to play various games over a network. The server handles multiple clients, authenticating them and facilitating game sessions. The client connects to the server, allowing players to choose games and opponents.

### Server
The server is implemented in Python and handles multiple client connections using threading. It manages user authentication, game sessions, and maintains a scoreboard.

#### Key Features:
User Authentication: Validates player credentials.
Game Management: Supports multiple games like TicTacToe, Connect4, and Hangman.
Scoreboard: Keeps track of player scores across sessions.
### Client
The client, also written in Python, connects to the server and provides an interface for the player to interact with the game server.

#### Key Features:
Game Selection: Players can choose from various games.
Opponent Selection: Players can select their opponents from the available online users.
Real-time Gameplay: Facilitates real-time gameplay with other players.
## Games
### TicTacToe
Grid-based Game: Players take turns marking a 3x3 grid.
Winning Condition: The first player to align three of their marks (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
### Connect4
Vertical Grid Game: Players drop colored discs into a 7-column, 6-row vertically suspended grid.
Winning Condition: The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own discs wins.
### Hangman
Word Guessing Game: One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters.
### Usage
Start the Server: Run the server script to start listening for client connections.
Connect as a Client: Run the client script and enter your credentials to connect to the server.
Choose a Game and Opponent: Select from the available games and choose an opponent from the list of online users.
Play the Game: Follow the on-screen instructions to play the selected game.
### Requirements
Python 3.x
Network connectivity between server and clients
### Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code. Run the server script on the host machine and client scripts on the player's machines.
